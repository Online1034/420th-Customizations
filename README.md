# 420th Customizations

An Arma 3 mod for the 420th Delta community.

This mod can work fully client-side. It's signed for multiplayer with a single bikey,
and the mod version does not need to match between server and clients
unless loaded as a required mod with [verifySignatures = 2](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/ArmA:_Armed_Assault:_Addon_Signatures).
